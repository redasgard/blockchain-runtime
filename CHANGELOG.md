## Migration Guide

### Getting Started

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed. Here's how to get started:

```rust
use blockchain_runtime::{BlockchainRuntime, Contract, Transaction};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create blockchain runtime
    let runtime = BlockchainRuntime::new("ethereum").await?;
    
    // Deploy contract
    let contract = runtime.deploy_contract(bytecode, constructor_args).await?;
    
    // Simulate transaction
    let result = runtime.simulate_transaction(
        contract.address(),
        "transfer",
        &[recipient, amount]
    ).await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Cross-Chain Support

```rust
use blockchain_runtime::BlockchainRuntime;

// Support for multiple blockchains
let ethereum = BlockchainRuntime::new("ethereum").await?;
let bitcoin = BlockchainRuntime::new("bitcoin").await?;
let solana = BlockchainRuntime::new("solana").await?;
let polkadot = BlockchainRuntime::new("polkadot").await?;
```
